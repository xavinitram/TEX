PORT-2 — the public, host-agnostic API facade.

A small stable surface over the internal compile/execute machinery, for the `tex run`
CLI (PORT-3) and future non-ComfyUI hosts. It calls straight through — `execute()` is
bit-for-bit identical to `Interpreter.execute`, and `compile()` wraps the cache's
6-tuple. The `Program` dataclass field NAMES are a public contract (a canary test pins
them), so a host can depend on `program.assigned` / `program.type_map` etc.

**Scope (doc 32 F4):** `execute()` runs the INTERPRETER ONLY and returns its RAW
per-output tensors — no tier selection, no fallbacks, no tiling, and deliberately none of
the ComfyUI IMAGE post-formatting (clamp to [0,1], alpha-drop to 3 channels, gray→RGB
broadcast, MASK/LATENT typing). So `execute(compile("@OUT=vec4(@A.rgb*3,1);"),
{"A": half_grey})` returns a `[1,H,W,4]` tensor with values to 1.5, where the node returns
a clamped `[1,H,W,3]` IMAGE.

**Which entry point do you want?** (v0.22 added the middle one, and it is usually the
answer — before ENG-1 the only way to reach the real engine was to import the ComfyUI node.)

    tex_api.execute      the interpreter, nothing else. The oracle. Bit-for-bit reference.
    tex_engine.cook      the ENGINE: tiers, fallbacks, OOM ladder, tiling, precision-auto.
                         What a host should cook with. Returns raw tensors.
    TEXWrangleNode.execute   the ComfyUI adapter. Only if you ARE ComfyUI.

For pixel-identical ComfyUI output without ComfyUI, cook through `tex_engine.cook` and
apply the `comfy` egress profile (ENG-3) — that pairing IS the node's conversion, and it
is what `tex run` does:

    from TEX_Wrangle import tex_engine
    from TEX_Wrangle.tex_marshalling import prepare_output, map_inferred_type
    res = tex_engine.cook(src, {"A": img}, device_mode="cuda")
    img_out = prepare_output(res.outputs["OUT"], map_inferred_type(res.assigned["OUT"], False),
                             profile="comfy")

`cook()` guarantees its outputs do not alias your input bindings; `execute()` makes no such
promise (`@OUT = @A;` hands back the tensor you passed in).

    from TEX_Wrangle.tex_api import compile, execute
    from TEX_Wrangle.tex_compiler.types import TEXType
    prog = compile("@OUT = vec4(@A.rgb * 1.2, 1.0);", {"A": TEXType.VEC3})
    out = execute(prog, {"A": img}, device="cuda", precision="auto")  # raw, unclamped
