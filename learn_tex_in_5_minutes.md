# Learn TEX in 5 Minutes

TEX lets you write compact code to process images in ComfyUI. Instead of wiring 10 nodes for a simple effect, write a few lines of TEX. Each example below builds on the previous one.

---

## 1. Hello World — Passthrough

```
@OUT = @image;
```

`@image` is your input — the name becomes an input socket on the node. `@OUT` is the output. This copies the input unchanged. You can use any name you like: `@photo`, `@base`, `@input` — TEX creates sockets automatically from `@name` references.

**Try it:** Create a TEX Wrangle node, connect an image to the `image` input, and queue the prompt. You should see the same image come out the other side.

---

## 2. Darken an Image

```
@OUT = @image * 0.5;
```

Multiply every pixel by 0.5 to darken the image. All operations happen per-pixel automatically — you never need to write loops.

---

## 3. Blend Two Images

```
f$blend = 0.5;
@OUT = lerp(@base, @overlay, $blend);
```

`lerp()` linearly interpolates between two values. `f$blend = 0.5;` creates a **FLOAT parameter widget** on the node with a default of 0.5 — you can adjust it without editing code. Connect two images to `base` and `overlay` to try this.

---

## 4. Procedural Gradient

```
@OUT = vec3(u, v, 0.5);
```

`u` and `v` are normalized coordinates that range from 0 to 1 across the image. `vec3(r, g, b)` creates a color. This produces a gradient that goes from red at the top-left to yellow-green at the bottom-right, with a constant blue channel of 0.5. You still need an input connected (e.g. `@ref`) so TEX knows what resolution to use.

---

## 5. Conditional Color

```
float gray = luma(@image);
if (gray > 0.5) {
    @OUT = vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
} else {
    @OUT = @image;
}
```

`luma()` computes the brightness of each pixel. Bright pixels become red, dark pixels keep their original color. The `if/else` works per-pixel automatically — under the hood it is vectorized via `torch.where`, so there is no performance penalty.

---

## 6. Parameters

```
f$strength = 0.5;
@OUT = @image * $strength;
```

Declare parameters with `$name` to create adjustable widgets on the node:

- `f$strength = 0.5;` → FLOAT slider (default 0.5)
- `i$radius = 2;` → INT spinner (default 2)
- `s$label = "hello";` → STRING text field
- `b$enabled = 1;` → BOOLEAN toggle
- `c$tint = "#FF8800";` → COLOR picker
- `v3$offset = vec3(1.0, 0.5, 0.0);` → VEC3 (X/Y/Z float inputs)

Parameter widgets appear directly on the node for easy adjustment at runtime. Color and vector parameters can also accept wire connections (IMAGE, MASK, etc.) to override the widget value.

---

## 7. Multiple Outputs

```
f$strength = 1.0;
@darkened = @image * vec3(1.0 - $strength);
@brightness_mask = luma(@image);
```

Write to any `@name` to create an output. Here, `darkened` and `brightness_mask` appear as separate output sockets. Connect each to a different downstream node.

## What's Next?

- Click the **?** icon on any TEX node for the full function reference (80+ functions).
- Browse the `examples/` folder for more patterns: blur, vignette, edge detection, noise, and more.
- Types: `float`, `int`, `vec3` (RGB), `vec4` (RGBA) — TEX infers types automatically.
- Use `@name` for any descriptive input name (e.g., `@base`, `@mask`, `@frames`).
- Output types (IMAGE, MASK, FLOAT, STRING, LATENT) are auto-inferred from your code.
